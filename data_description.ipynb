The seven fields that follow the id are associated with the institution where the applicant found a job.  There are two id numbers `to_institution_id` and `to_oid`.  The first points to a university whose name is given in text by `to_name`.  The second points to an department or school within the university to distinguish between, say, an economics department and a business school.  The two fields `latitude` and `longitude` are geo-coordinates. The field `to_rank` is a ranking for the destination school.  \n",
